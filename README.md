# ThreeJS_MDT
 
This is the code of the Thoughts in Motion's Three JS visualization. You will find a cycle camera button on the top left corner of the window to switch between the different cameras and you will see two red circles in the first room of the ship representing the interactions in the Unity project (try them out by putting your cursor on them).
